<H2> <u> <strong> Active Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.






<H2> <u> <strong>Passive Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.

 <H1> <u> <strong> Malware definition  </strong> </u> </H1>
 
Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. As Microsoft puts it, "[malware] is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.

This means that the question of, say, what the difference is between malware and a virus misses the point a bit: a virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware (but not every piece of malware is a virus).



  <H2> <u> <strong> Types of malware  </strong> </u> </H2>
  
There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. You've probably heard the words virus, trojan, and worm used interchangeably, but as Symantec explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:

 <H3> <u> <strong> -A worm   </strong> </u> </H3>  is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.
 
<H3> <u> <strong> -A virus   </strong> </u> </H3> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.
 

<H3> <u> <strong> -A trojan  </strong> </u> </H3> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.

Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. 

Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:

 <H3> <u> <strong> -Spyware  </strong> </u> </H3> is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing passwords.

 <H1> <u> <strong> Software and hardware to protect network  </strong> </u> </H1>
 
A firewall has a significant role to play when it comes to filtering your internet traffic that is going in and out of your system. You can instruct the firewall to obstruct traffic automatically, or you can select an option in which firewall asks you before blocking the traffic. There are two different kinds of firewall security types – hardware and software. You can choose one according to your requirements. Go through the following guide by Sonicwall Sales to know the critical difference between Firewall Hardware and Firewall Software:

  <H2> <u> <strong>Firewall Hardware: </strong> </u> </H2>

Most companies install hardware firewalls that help to prevent threats within a particular range of networks. By using a hardware firewall, a company can filter traffic for the bulk of the systems without any need of tracking each machine available on its premises. It is convenient for large corporations and big companies that have lots of devices getting exposed to security threat every day. In typical cases, the firewall hardware is placed between internet connection and router thereby avoiding malicious connections penetrating into your network. It is a dedicated device that carries out firewall function without the need of consuming any resources on your computer.

A hardware firewall can be used as a stand-alone device, or it can be integrated with any other device to perform multi-functionality. When it comes to hardware firewall upgrades, only one update will help to secure all the devices within a network which is not the case with the software solution. As hardware firewall features its own operating system, you can avail greater level of security and speed. It is less vulnerable to viruses or malware attacks and capable of dealing with a more significant traffic load than a software product.

However, repair and maintenance are significant limitations that come with a hardware solution. Also, when the firewall is attacked, the entire network gets compromised.

  <H2> <u> <strong> Firewall Software:  </strong> </u> </H2>

Most of the times, you don’t have your Smartphone or computer operating within your own secured network. This is why having a software firewall installed on your device offers you extra protection no matter which route you go. The firewall software can provide you different levels of security for different profiles such as work, home or public places. You can manage settings for each of the profiles to ensure a high level of protection whenever required.

Firewall software is more affordable and convenient to install when compared with firewall hardware. However, it consumes a more substantial amount of your system’s resources and sometimes creates compatibility problems when clashes with other applications installed in your system. Most of the latest operating systems come with inbuilt firewall solutions which are very flexible and powerful. As it is easy to update, you don’t face any incompatibility issues when using a new version.

If you want to achieve a perfect firewall, then you can consider installing both firewall software and hardware on your network. In case you are dealing with a highly sensitive customer data and need to comply with strict guidelines for cyber prevention then opt for a combination of both.

  <H1> <u> <strong> Network protocols   </strong>  </u> </H1> 
 
On Sept 11, 2006, ICANN “ratified a global policy for the allocation of IPv6 addresses by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)”. While the standard itself was ratified many years (like a decade) before, without a policy governing the allocation of those addresses it really wasn’t all that significant. But as of 2006 we were serious about moving toward IPv6. After all, the web was growing, mobile was exploding, and available IPv4 addresses were dwindling to nothing.

We needed IPv6 if not for its enhanced security then for its expanded address space that would allow us to support billions of connected devices and things.

And yet the adoption rate is abysmal. Consider that “the cloud” was born in an age when IPv6 was available. And yet it took until late 2016 for Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure to turn on IPv6 in their cloud offerings for compute instances.  

This has led some to lamenting that if we can get HTTPS almost everywhere in such a short time, why are we still seeing such a small percentage of sites supporting IPv6? Google estimates that 16.06% of users are IPv6 enabled (which is interesting when compared to service providers support as tracked by the World IPv6 Launch) but only 10% of web sites (according to W3C Techs) support it.

To be fair, HTTPS was not new. EFF was merely encouraging and empowering folks to enable what was already at their fingertips. HTTPS is well-supported, well-understood, and thoroughly baked. So perhaps it would be more fair to compare it to a newer standard, one with similar drawbacks such as incompatibility with previous standards, like HTTP/2.

Back in May 2015, a new version of a stalwart web standard was ratified: HTTP/2. Like IPv6, it is incompatible with previous versions. Unlike “SSL Everywhere”, supporting IPv6 or HTTP/2 is not simply a case of acquiring a certificate and enabling HTTPS on your web servers or infrastructure. While it’s true that moving from HTTP to HTTPS can be disruptive – it can impact your network infrastructure – it’s not the same level of disruption as incurred by IPv6 or HTTP/2.

Moving to new foundational protocols requires a transitional approach; one that requires support for both the old and the new simultaneously until some future point in time. That means “dual-stacks” for every device through which traffic might flow. This is a Herculean effort for some organizations, and an architectural nightmare for others. Just as software incurs technical debt, networks incur architectural debt, and it is likely the case that the “interest payments” on that architectural debt make it difficult to build a valid case for adopting IPv6. After all, it’s not like it’s a requirement or anything. Business will continue if you don’t support IPv6.

Or will it?

Let’s remember that originally, HTTP/2 was going to require TLS/SSL. There was some grumbling and eventually it was made optional. Browser builders blithely ignored that and only provided support for HTTP/2 over TLS/SSL, effectively forcing the requirement on everyone. In late 2015 Google began prioritizing HTTPS-enabled sites in search rankings. And in 2016, Apple made similar moves that required all native apps to use App Transport Security, again effectively forcing the move to HTTPS.

Basically, HTTPS has been forced by those on the client side to support it.

For IPv6 right now there’s no similar requirement. We all watched as IPv4 addresses disappeared but it had relatively little or no impact. So no one feels a real impetus (yet) to make a move that’s potentially going to be disruptive and expensive. But as more things emerge it’s entirely possible that they’ll eventually come out of the box supporting only IPv6. Things have small form factors and their processing power is limited. Less is more in the Internet of Things. That’s one of the reasons many IoT devices eschew HTTP in favor of MQTT; it’s smaller, faster, and more efficient than its heavier web cousin. Supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 is similar. Because they are incompatible most devices support one or the other. And eventually they’re going to choose one and everyone will be scrambling to support.


   <H2> <u> <strong> Digital certificates and certificate authorities  </strong>  </u> </H2> 
 
  <H2> <u> <strong> What is a Digital Certificate </strong>  </u> </H2>
 
Digital certificates are electronic credentials that are used to assert the online identities of individuals, computers, and other entities on a network. Digital certificates function similarly to identification cards such as passports and drivers licenses. Most commonly they contain a public key and the identity of the owner. They are issued by certification authorities (CAs) that must validate the identity of the certificate-holder both before the certificate is issued and when the certificate is used. Common uses include business scenarios requiring authentication, encryption, and digital signing.
Certificate Purposes
The certificate purpose defines the intended primary use of the certificate. The certificate purpose can be one of four settings:

Encryption. A certificate with this purpose will contain cryptographic keys for encryption and decryption.
Signature. A certificate with this purpose will contain cryptographic keys for signing data only.
Signature and encryption. A certificate with this purpose covers all primary uses of a certificate’s cryptographic key, including encryption of data, decryption of data, initial logon, or digitally signing data.
Signature and smartcard logon. A certificate with this purpose allows for initial logon with a smart card, and digitally signing data; it cannot be used for data encryption.
SSL is probably the first protocol to use digital certificates. Now a days they are widely used where ever there is a need for signing and encryption.

 <H2> <u> <strong> Certificate Authority  </strong>  </u> </H2>

A Certificate Authority (CA) issues digital certificates that contain a public key and the identity of the owner. The matching private key is not made available publicly, but kept secret by the end user who generated the key pair. The certificate is also a confirmation or validation by the CA that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to the person, organization, server or other entity noted in the certificate. A CA's obligation in such schemes is to verify an applicant's credentials, so that users and relying parties can trust the information in the CA's certificates. CAs use a variety of standards and tests to do so. In essence, the Certificate Authority is responsible for saying "yes, this person is who they say they are, and we, the CA, verify that".

If the user trusts the CA and can verify the CA's signature, then he can also verify that a certain public key does indeed belong to whoever is identified in the certificate. Browsers maintain list of well known CAs root certificates.  Aside from commercial CAs, some providers issue digital certificates to the public at no cost. Large institutions or government entities may have their own CAs.
