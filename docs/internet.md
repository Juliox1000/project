<H2> <u> <strong> Active Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.






<H2> <u> <strong>Passive Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.

 <H1> <u> <strong> Malware definition  </strong> </u> </H1>
 
Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. As Microsoft puts it, "[malware] is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.

This means that the question of, say, what the difference is between malware and a virus misses the point a bit: a virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware (but not every piece of malware is a virus).



  <H2> <u> <strong> Types of malware  </strong> </u> </H2>
  
There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. You've probably heard the words virus, trojan, and worm used interchangeably, but as Symantec explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:

 <H3> <u> <strong> -A worm   </strong> </u> </H3>  is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.
 
<H3> <u> <strong> -A virus   </strong> </u> </H3> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.
 

<H3> <u> <strong> -A trojan  </strong> </u> </H3> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.

Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. 

Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:

 <H3> <u> <strong> -Spyware  </strong> </u> </H3> is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing passwords.

 It is predicted that by 2021, cybercrime damages will amount to an annual total world cost of $6 trillion,1 even outpacing the yearly cost of damages attributed to natural disasters. And on an individual company level these damages can be just as catastrophic; the average cost of a cyberattack is currently $1.67 million,2 with operational and productivity loss, along with negative customer experience, being the primary consequences of suffering an attack.

14 Network Security Tools and Techniques to Know
Realize the true ROI of your tools and gain critical visibility. READ EBOOK
Your data is the lifeblood of your business: It supports your growth, carries vital resources and helps your organization stay healthy. And if data is blood, then your network is the beating heart that pumps it through your system. But modern cyber threats are like vampires, doing everything possible to get at the blood that keeps your business going.  

In order to defend against these vampiric threats and save your business from potentially millions of dollars in data loss, you need more than just a stake and some cloves of garlic; you need effective, robust network security and network visibility.

In this post, we’ll address the following 14 network security tools:

Access control
Anti-malware software
Anomaly detection
Application security
Data loss prevent (DLP)
Email security
Endpoint security
Firewall
Intrusion prevention systems
Network segmentation
Security information and event management (SIEM)
Virtual private network (VPN)
Web security
Wireless security
But first let’s cover the basics.

  <H2> <u> <strong> What Is Network Security?  </strong> </u> </H2>
Network security is a term that describes the security tools, tactics and security policies designed to monitor, prevent and respond to unauthorized network intrusion, while also protecting digital assets, including network traffic. Network security includes hardware and software technologies (including resources such as savvy security analysts, hunters, incident responders, etc.) and is designed to respond to the full range of potential threats targeting your network.

So, to put it simply, the answer to the question “what is network security?” is this: Network security is the defense you use to keep the wrong people away from your sensitive data.

The vampires are trying to get in; network security keeps them out. Fairly straightforward, right? Well, within that definition, there are three key focuses that should serve as a foundation of any network security strategy: protection, detection and response.

Protection entails any tools or policies designed to prevent network security intrusion. Detection refers to the resources that allow you to analyze network traffic and quickly identify problems before they can do harm. And finally, response is the ability to react to identified network security threats and resolve them as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately, most businesses simply do not know how to follow policy and do this properly. In fact, in a survey of 4,100 executives, departmental heads, IT managers and other key professionals across the U.S. and Europe, it was revealed that nearly three out of four organizations (73 percent)3 are fielding a novice level cybersecurity strategy. This is a growing threat, because when network breaches occur and malicious threats come through, there’s more at stake than just the data itself.

  <H2> <u> <strong> Benefits of Network Security </strong> </u> </H2>
Network security devices and tools exist to help your organization protect not only its sensitive information, but also its overall performance, reputation and even its ability to stay in business. Continued operational ability and an intact reputation are two key benefits of effective network security.

Companies that fall prey to cyberattacks often find themselves crippled from the inside out, unable to deliver services or effectively address customer needs. Similarly, networks play a major role in internal company processes, and when they come under attack, those processes may grind to a halt, further hampering an organization’s ability to conduct business or even resume standard operations.

But perhaps even more damaging is the detrimental effect that a network breach can have on your business’s reputation.

Given the rising tide of identity theft and other dangers related to the theft of personal information, many customers are already hesitant when it comes to sharing data with businesses. And if a cyberattack should occur, many of these customers are likely to withdraw in favor of more secure alternatives. After all, why take the risk?

The loss or corruption of valuable data, along with a significant disruption to customer services and internal process, topped off with reputational injury that may persist long after other damages have been repaired — it’s not hard to see what’s at stake when it comes to network security. In fact, it’s been suggested that 66 percent of SMBs4 would have to shut down (either temporarily or permanently) after experiencing a data breach. And even larger, more established businesses may be unable to reclaim their former standing.

On the other hand, reliable network security software and hardware, coupled with the right policies and strategies, can help ensure that when cyberattacks occur, their impact will be minimal.

  <H2> <u> <strong>Network Security Tools and Techniques  </strong> </u> </H2>

Your network faces threats of all shapes and sizes, and thus should be prepared to defend, identify and respond to a full range of attacks. But the reality is that the biggest danger to most companies are not fly-by-night threat actors, but rather attackers that are well-funded and are targeting specific organizations for specific reasons. For that reason, your network security strategy needs to be able to address the various methods these actors might employ.

Here are 14 different network security tools and techniques designed to help you do just that:

 <H3> <u> <strong> Access control </strong> </u> </H3>

If threat actors can’t access your network, the amount of damage they’ll be able to do will be extremely limited. But in addition to preventing unauthorized access, be aware that even authorized users can also be potential threats. Access control allows you to increase your network security by limiting user access and resources to only the parts of the network that directly apply to individual users’ responsibilities.
Anti-malware software
Malware, in the form of viruses, trojans, worms, keyloggers, spyware, etc. are designed to spread through computer systems and infect networks. Anti-malware tools are a kind of network security software designed to identify dangerous programs and prevent them from spreading. Anti-malware and antivirus software may also be able to help resolve malware infections, minimizing the damage to the network.
Anomaly detection
It can be difficult to identify anomalies in your network without a baseline understanding of how that network should be operating. Network anomaly detection engines (ADE) allow you to analyze your network, so that when breaches occur, you’ll be alerted to them quickly enough to be able to respond.
Application security
For many attackers, applications are a defensive vulnerability that can be exploited. Application security helps establish security parameters for any applications that may be relevant to your network security.
Data loss prevention (DLP)
Often, the weakest link in network security is the human element. DLP technologies and policies help protect staff and other users from misusing and possibly compromising sensitive data or allowing said data out of the network.
Email security
As with DLP, email security is focused on shoring up human-related security weaknesses. Via phishing strategies (which are often very complex and convincing), attackers persuade email recipients to share sensitive information via desktop or mobile device, or inadvertently download malware into the targeted network. Email security helps identify dangerous emails and can also be used to block attacks and prevent the sharing of vital data.
Endpoint security
The business world is becoming increasingly bring your own device (BYOD), to the point where the distinction between personal and business computer devices is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately, sometimes the personal devices become targets when users rely on them to access business networks. Endpoint security adds a layer of defense between remote devices and business networks.

 <H3> <u> <strong> Firewalls  </strong> </u> </H3>

Firewalls function much like gates that can be used to secure the borders between your network and the internet. Firewalls are used to manage network traffic, allowing authorized traffic through while blocking access to non-authorized traffic.
Intrusion prevention systems
Intrusion prevention systems (also called intrusion detection) constantly scan and analyze network traffic/packets, so that different types of attacks can be identified and responded to quickly. These systems often keep a database of known attack methods, so as to be able to recognize threats immediately.
Network segmentation
There are many kinds of network traffic, each associated with different security risks. Network segmentation allows you to grant the right access to the right traffic, while restricting traffic from suspicious sources.
Security information and event management (SIEM)
Sometimes simply pulling together the right information from so many different tools and resources can be prohibitively difficult — particularly when time is an issue. SIEM tools and software give responders the data they need to act quickly.
Virtual private network (VPN)
VPN tools are used to authenticate communication between secure networks and an endpoint device. Remote-access VPNs generally use IPsec or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for 
authentication, creating an encrypted line to block other parties from eavesdropping.
Web security

Including tools, hardware, policies and more, web security is a blanket term to describe the network security measures businesses take to ensure safe web use when connected to an internal network. This helps prevent web-based threats from using browsers as access points to get into the network.
Wireless security

Generally speaking, wireless networks are less secure than traditional networks. Thus, strict wireless security measures are necessary to ensure that threat actors aren’t gaining access.

  <H1> <u> <strong> Network protocols  <H1> <u> <strong>
 
 The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.

IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.

Historically, IP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974, which was complemented by a connection-oriented service that became the basis for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as TCP/IP.

The first major version of IP, Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since c. 2006.

  <H2> <u> <strong> Function <H2> <u> <strong>

In May 1974, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published a paper entitled "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication".[4] The paper's authors, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes. A central control component of this model was the "Transmission Control Program" that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol at the transport layer and the Internet Protocol at the internet layer. The model became known as the Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model and Internet protocol suite, and informally as TCP/IP.

IP versions 1 to 3 were experimental versions, designed between 1973 and 1978.[5] The following Internet Experiment Note (IEN) documents describe version 3 of the Internet Protocol, prior to the modern version of IPv4:

IEN 2 (Comments on Internet Protocol and TCP), dated August 1977 describes the need to separate the TCP and Internet Protocol functionalities (which were previously combined.) It proposes the first version of the IP header, using 0 for the version field.
IEN 26 (A Proposed New Internet Header Format), dated February 1978 describes a version of the IP header that uses a 1-bit version field.
IEN 28 (Draft Internetwork Protocol Description Version 2), dated February 1978 describes IPv2.
IEN 41 (Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4), dated June 1978 describes the first protocol to be called IPv4. The IP header is different from the modern IPv4 header.
IEN 44 (Latest Header Formats), dated June 1978 describes another version of IPv4, also with a header different from the modern IPv4 header.
IEN 54 (Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4), dated September 1978 is the first description of IPv4 using the header that would be standardized in RFC 760.
The dominant internetworking protocol in the Internet Layer in use is IPv4; the number 4 identifies the protocol version, carried in every IP datagram. IPv4 is described in RFC 791 (1981).

Version number 5 was used by the Internet Stream Protocol, an experimental streaming protocol that was not adopted.[5]

The successor to IPv4 is IPv6. IPv6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX (RFC 1475), PIP (RFC 1621) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, RFC 1347). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses 32 bits for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 billion (4.3×109) addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses providing ca. 3.4×1038 addresses. Although adoption of IPv6 has been slow, as of June 2008, all United States government systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for IPv6.[6]

The assignment of the new protocol as IPv6 was uncertain until due diligence assured that IPv6 had not been used previously.[7] Other Internet Layer protocols have been assigned version numbers,[8] such as 7 (IP/TX), 8 and 9 (historic). Notably, on April 1, 1994, the IETF published an April Fools' Day joke about IPv9.[9] IPv9 was also used in an alternate proposed address space expansion called TUBA.
