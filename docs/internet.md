<H2> <u> <strong> Active Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.






<H2> <u> <strong>Passive Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.

 <H1> <u> <strong> Malware definition  </strong> </u> </H1>
 
Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. As Microsoft puts it, "[malware] is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.

This means that the question of, say, what the difference is between malware and a virus misses the point a bit: a virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware (but not every piece of malware is a virus).



  <H2> <u> <strong> Types of malware  </strong> </u> </H2>
  
There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. You've probably heard the words virus, trojan, and worm used interchangeably, but as Symantec explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:

 <H3> <u> <strong> -A worm   </strong> </u> </H3>  is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.
 
<H3> <u> <strong> -A virus   </strong> </u> </H3> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.
 

-<H3> <u> <strong> A trojan  </strong> </u> </H3> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.

Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. 

Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:

 -<H3> <u> <strong> Spyware  </strong> </u> </H3> is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makesâ€”great for stealing passwords.
