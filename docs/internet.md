<H2> <u> <strong> Active Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed. The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.






<H2> <u> <strong>Passive Attacks:  </strong> </u> </H2>
Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack.

 <H1> <u> <strong> Malware definition  </strong> </u> </H1>
 
Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. As Microsoft puts it, "[malware] is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.

This means that the question of, say, what the difference is between malware and a virus misses the point a bit: a virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware (but not every piece of malware is a virus).



  <H2> <u> <strong> Types of malware  </strong> </u> </H2>
  
There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. You've probably heard the words virus, trojan, and worm used interchangeably, but as Symantec explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:

 <H3> <u> <strong> -A worm   </strong> </u> </H3>  is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.
 
<H3> <u> <strong> -A virus   </strong> </u> </H3> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.
 

<H3> <u> <strong> -A trojan  </strong> </u> </H3> is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.

Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. 

Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:

 <H3> <u> <strong> -Spyware  </strong> </u> </H3> is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing passwords.

 <H1> <u> <strong> Software and hardware to protect network  </strong> </u> </H1>
 
A firewall has a significant role to play when it comes to filtering your internet traffic that is going in and out of your system. You can instruct the firewall to obstruct traffic automatically, or you can select an option in which firewall asks you before blocking the traffic. There are two different kinds of firewall security types – hardware and software. You can choose one according to your requirements. Go through the following guide by Sonicwall Sales to know the critical difference between Firewall Hardware and Firewall Software:

  <H2> <u> <strong>Firewall Hardware: </strong> </u> </H2>

Most companies install hardware firewalls that help to prevent threats within a particular range of networks. By using a hardware firewall, a company can filter traffic for the bulk of the systems without any need of tracking each machine available on its premises. It is convenient for large corporations and big companies that have lots of devices getting exposed to security threat every day. In typical cases, the firewall hardware is placed between internet connection and router thereby avoiding malicious connections penetrating into your network. It is a dedicated device that carries out firewall function without the need of consuming any resources on your computer.

A hardware firewall can be used as a stand-alone device, or it can be integrated with any other device to perform multi-functionality. When it comes to hardware firewall upgrades, only one update will help to secure all the devices within a network which is not the case with the software solution. As hardware firewall features its own operating system, you can avail greater level of security and speed. It is less vulnerable to viruses or malware attacks and capable of dealing with a more significant traffic load than a software product.

However, repair and maintenance are significant limitations that come with a hardware solution. Also, when the firewall is attacked, the entire network gets compromised.

  <H2> <u> <strong> Firewall Software:  </strong> </u> </H2>

Most of the times, you don’t have your Smartphone or computer operating within your own secured network. This is why having a software firewall installed on your device offers you extra protection no matter which route you go. The firewall software can provide you different levels of security for different profiles such as work, home or public places. You can manage settings for each of the profiles to ensure a high level of protection whenever required.

Firewall software is more affordable and convenient to install when compared with firewall hardware. However, it consumes a more substantial amount of your system’s resources and sometimes creates compatibility problems when clashes with other applications installed in your system. Most of the latest operating systems come with inbuilt firewall solutions which are very flexible and powerful. As it is easy to update, you don’t face any incompatibility issues when using a new version.

If you want to achieve a perfect firewall, then you can consider installing both firewall software and hardware on your network. In case you are dealing with a highly sensitive customer data and need to comply with strict guidelines for cyber prevention then opt for a combination of both.

  <H1> <u> <strong> Network protocols   </strong>  <u> </H1> 
 
 The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.

IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.

Historically, IP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974, which was complemented by a connection-oriented service that became the basis for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as TCP/IP.

The first major version of IP, Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since c. 2006.

  <H2> <u> <strong> Function <H2> <u> <strong>

In May 1974, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published a paper entitled "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication".[4] The paper's authors, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes. A central control component of this model was the "Transmission Control Program" that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol at the transport layer and the Internet Protocol at the internet layer. The model became known as the Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model and Internet protocol suite, and informally as TCP/IP.

IP versions 1 to 3 were experimental versions, designed between 1973 and 1978.[5] The following Internet Experiment Note (IEN) documents describe version 3 of the Internet Protocol, prior to the modern version of IPv4:

IEN 2 (Comments on Internet Protocol and TCP), dated August 1977 describes the need to separate the TCP and Internet Protocol functionalities (which were previously combined.) It proposes the first version of the IP header, using 0 for the version field.
IEN 26 (A Proposed New Internet Header Format), dated February 1978 describes a version of the IP header that uses a 1-bit version field.
IEN 28 (Draft Internetwork Protocol Description Version 2), dated February 1978 describes IPv2.
IEN 41 (Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4), dated June 1978 describes the first protocol to be called IPv4. The IP header is different from the modern IPv4 header.
IEN 44 (Latest Header Formats), dated June 1978 describes another version of IPv4, also with a header different from the modern IPv4 header.
IEN 54 (Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4), dated September 1978 is the first description of IPv4 using the header that would be standardized in RFC 760.
The dominant internetworking protocol in the Internet Layer in use is IPv4; the number 4 identifies the protocol version, carried in every IP datagram. IPv4 is described in RFC 791 (1981).

Version number 5 was used by the Internet Stream Protocol, an experimental streaming protocol that was not adopted.[5]

The successor to IPv4 is IPv6. IPv6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX (RFC 1475), PIP (RFC 1621) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, RFC 1347). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses 32 bits for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 billion (4.3×109) addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses providing ca. 3.4×1038 addresses. Although adoption of IPv6 has been slow, as of June 2008, all United States government systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for IPv6.[6]

The assignment of the new protocol as IPv6 was uncertain until due diligence assured that IPv6 had not been used previously.[7] Other Internet Layer protocols have been assigned version numbers,[8] such as 7 (IP/TX), 8 and 9 (historic). Notably, on April 1, 1994, the IETF published an April Fools' Day joke about IPv9.[9] IPv9 was also used in an alternate proposed address space expansion called TUBA.
